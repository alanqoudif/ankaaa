2. Add it to your environment variables as `OPENAI_API_KEY`

For Claude model support:
1. Get an API key from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/account/keys)
2. Add it to your environment variables as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

## Troubleshooting

- **Application not starting**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and API keys are set up
- **PDF processing errors**: Make sure PDFs are not encrypted and are in a readable format
- **Arabic text display issues**: Verify that arabic-reshaper and python-bidi are installed correctly
